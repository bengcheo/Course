Module name of choice - Introduction to Git and Github

Reason being not many people in my industry are familiar with Git and Github, so not many opportunities to learn.
The three which I learned are:
1) the entire flow of cloning, forking, pushing, pulling etc.
2) what is commit and other git commands
3) how to use git in general
